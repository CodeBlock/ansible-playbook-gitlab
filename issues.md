# Possible painpoints for FI, or at least things worth noting.

* Requires Ruby 1.9.x and fairly new Rails, but RHEL has Ruby 1.8.x
* Requires a ton of unpackaged RubyGems - for now, I just let it bundle these itself with Bundler.
* Requires a patched gitolite (https://github.com/gitlabhq/gitolite)
